# üêç Python for Kids - Summer Coding Camp  

This repository contains the **Python learning materials** and **worksheets** used for a **summer coding camp** I conducted for school kids in the US. The curriculum was designed to introduce Python programming in a fun and engaging way, incorporating **interactive coding exercises** and **Turtle graphics** to help young learners grasp fundamental programming concepts.  

<br />

## üìå About the Course  

- **Designed for**: School kids (beginners)  
- **Topics Covered**: Python basics, Turtle graphics, problem-solving through worksheets  
- **Teaching Methodology**:  
  - **Reference materials** for conceptual understanding  
  - **Worksheets** for hands-on practice  
  - **Final project** where students built their own Python applications  

<br />

## üèÜ Final Assessment  

- **Online Test**:  
  To evaluate their understanding of Python concepts, students took an **online test** covering topics such as variables, loops, conditions, and Turtle graphics.  

- **Project Submission**:  
  As a final challenge, students applied their learning by building their own **Python projects**. They submitted their code, showcasing their creativity and problem-solving skills.  

<br />
